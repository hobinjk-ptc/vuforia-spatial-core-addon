The first input is used to toggle which output the second input gets sent to. <br>
If a high value (>= 0.5) is sent into the first input, all values that arrive at the second input will output to the first output. If a low value is sent into the first input, all values that arrive at the second input will output to the second output. <br>
This was designed to let an on-off switch toggle which video will play next in a sequence.
