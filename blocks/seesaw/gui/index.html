This is a specific kind of switch, where the first two inputs control whether to stream data through the third input to the third output.<br>
<br>

Input 1: The "Off" Switch:<br>
If the first input receives a high value, and the switch was flipped on, flip it back off (and emit a 1 from the first output and a 0 from the second).<br>
<br>

Input 2: The "On" Switch:<br>
If the second input receives a high value, and the switch was flipped off, flip it back on (and emit a 0 from the first output and a 1 from the second).<br>
<br>

Input 3: The Data Stream:<br>
If the third input receives any data, and the switch was flipped on, output the data from the third output. If the switch is off, do nothing.<br>
