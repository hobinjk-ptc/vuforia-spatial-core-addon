# Vuforia Spatial Edge Server Code Add-on

This is the core-addon for the Vuforia Spatial Edge Server. It provides a
baseline set of blocks, interfaces, nodes, and tools to the Edge Server. The
server loads code from blocks, interfaces, and nodes. The editor user interface
loads blocks, nodes, and tools.

## Blocks

Logic blocks available in the data crafting board.

## Interfaces

Hardware interfaces which translate between the hardwareInterface.js API and
the hardware.

## Nodes

Programming nodes associated with an object that can produce and consume
values.

## Tools

Tools which the user can place on objects or float in world space to provide
useful interactions.

## Content Scripts

Low-level scripts placed directly into the user interface's context as if they
were part of the editor's code.
